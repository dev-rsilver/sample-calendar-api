# Sample API

This sample project implements an API for a [front-end sample](https://github.com/dev-rsilver/sample-calendar-front-end) 
that features a React-based calendar. This API utilizes NodeJS and demonstrates routing, validation, JWT authentication, 
CORS, and an object-oriented coding style.
